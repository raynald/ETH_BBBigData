\section{Conclusion}

We came up with the idea to design CLUE when we talked about warm winter in Zurich. Why not design a system to visualize climate change on the global scale?  

Althgouh the result of our project is quite subjective, there is an optimal number of clusters. After enough iterations, the result remains a good quality. For the ones with less number of clusters, it would take less time to compute while for bigger number of clusters, it would take more time. From \cite{sklearn}'s website, there is a note for the complexity of algorithm:
\begin{quote}
The k-means problem is solved using Lloyd’s algorithm.

The average complexity is given by $O(k n T)$, were n is the number of samples and T is the number of iteration.

The worst case complexity is given by $O(n^{(k+2/p)})$ with n = n\_samples, p = n\_features. (D. Arthur and S. Vassilvitskii, `How slow is the k-means method?' SoCG2006)

In practice, the k-means algorithm is very fast (one of the fastest clustering algorithms available), but it falls in local minima. That’s why it can be useful to restart it several times.
\end{quote}
Where in our experiment, we choose $150$ clusters and $500$ iterations. The solution quality would improve if we use more `useful' data. We throw away the station which have huge number of missing values. The more `useful' data we use, the more computational effort would take. So that's the trade-off.

\subsection{Difficulties}
It is really hard to design such a system like CLUE. We encountered several difficulties during the projects. The top major ones are listed below:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The size of Dataset is too big to fit in the memory;
    \item Too in-efficient to run K-means on the whole dataset;
    \item Install Python tools in the remote machine.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Lecture Learned}
From this project, we learned quite a lot lessons, which could be improved when we do future big data project:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Debug thoroughly before implementing it in a distributed system;
    \item Save the log whenever necessary.
    \item Do as early as we can in order to leave enough time for testing
\end{itemize}

\section{Future Work}
In future, we have two directions to go to improve CLUE's performance: one is related with features, the other is about the clustering algorithm:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Create more features and do feature selection;
    \item Other clustering algorithms, maybe GMM.
\end{itemize}
