\abstract{Climate change has been one of the major global concerns regarding the ecosystem. By effectively analysing the pattern of climate change, we would be able to revolutionize our strategy in preserving ecosystems and sustainable development. Millions of sensor has been
deployed to monitor different climate measurement, which generate gigantic volume of data in every minute. The amount of data exerts challenges for efficient analysing after accumulation over several decades. One of most challenge lies in the visualization of climate type and evolving pattern, which would be an essential step to turn noisy and large-scale data into source of meaningful information. In milestone 2, we use ?????2013data as a toy example to illustrate our algorithm on visualizing climate pattern. We employ unsupervised clustering approach to classify different climate types and visualize our clustering results with GoogleMap. In our experiment, we observed reasonable clustering of climate patterns with respect to geological property and development level. In the future, we would utilize much larger volume of data and extend to visualizing the evolution of climate patterns.}
